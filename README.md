## Work Done
- Write the html structure and the script.
It was easier to write first the script and modify the DOM as needed for every task, I isolated my work by working on only a task each time, this was very helpful to avoid mistakes in the conditionals statements. The styles were made later    

- Add Event Listeneres.
I used one event listener for each task. They were the same "click" type, but needed differents uses.
  
- Style the whole page, didn't need to do a mobile layout from scratch because i am working with bootstrap on this project.
- Add alt text for every image, and removed unused images.
- Add the Readme.
